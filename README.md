Fancy Database Backup
=====================

A database backup module for webtrees.

The latest release of this module requires [webtrees 1.7.0](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) or later. Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_database_backup/releases/latest).

Description
-----------
This is a very small module with a very powerful purpose. It provides the ability to include the excellent "MySQLDumper" backup software into your webtrees administration panel options. Throughout webtrees documentation you are very sensibly advised to back up your database at frequent intervals, and especially before any upgrade. If your webhost provides a tool like PhpMyAdmin or cPanel you should, if you know how, be able to use that. But for greater flexibility, simplicty and convenience MySQLDumper is hard to beat.

*Note: Since MySQLDumper is no longer maintained and incompatible with PHP7, MySQLDumper is replaced with MyOOSDumper which is a part of [MyOOS](https://github.com/r23/MyOOS/tree/master/msd).*
